The aim of this project is to control a robot and scenery, in order to being able to offer a solution to the following missions:

    1- Move To (ways to start the mission, performance)
    2- Take a Picture of Location (photo quality assessed by the World Press Photo international panel)
    3- Is Someone Home? (person detection, search algorithm, recognition of a specific person)
    4- Is Table Clean? (perception of objects on the table, performance)
    5- Search for Object in Location (ways to start the mission, performance)
    6- How Many Objects are in the House? (for example, how many blue cubes are in the house, performance)
    7- Touch Object at Location (performance, variant of dropping the object, grabbing the object)

The robot should have sensors that allow the mapping of the spaces and objects that spawn in the house. 
It must be able to classify colors, the objects and navigate through the rooms by teleoperation, while avoidding obstacles.
